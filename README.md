## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Sahil,  and I'm an Data Science/Engineering student interested in all things AI, Software Engr and Data Science


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building an AI-powered travel agent which creates better and efficient decisions.
- ğŸŒ± I recently built a software project which was a Pet Adoption site, which you can create a account and adopt Pets.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything where I can learn and gain more experience!
